# Ultra-Optimized Hero Section

## Overview
This is a complete revamp of the hero section animation system designed to eliminate lag and provide silky-smooth performance across all devices.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. **No Framer Motion**
- Replaced all Framer Motion animations with pure CSS animations
- CSS animations are hardware-accelerated and much more performant
- Uses `transform` and `opacity` properties only for best performance

### 2. **Critical Image Preloading**
- Preloads the hero background image before starting animations
- Prevents layout shifts and ensures smooth visual transitions
- Shows loading fallback while images load

### 3. **Hardware Acceleration**
- Uses `transform: translateZ(0)` to force GPU acceleration
- Applies `will-change` strategically and removes it after animations
- Uses `contain` property for paint optimization

### 4. **Device-Aware Performance**
- Detects low-end devices and reduces animation complexity
- Faster animations on mobile devices
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting

### 5. **RequestAnimationFrame Timing**
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation timing
- Staggered animations with optimized delays
- Immediate rendering for reduced motion preferences

### 6. **CSS Optimization**
- Separate CSS file with optimized animation keyframes
- Mobile-specific optimizations
- Backdrop blur only on capable devices

## Performance Benefits

1. **Reduced CPU Usage**: CSS animations run on GPU instead of JavaScript thread
2. **Smooth 60fps**: Optimized for consistent frame rates
3. **Faster Load Times**: Critical resource preloading
4. **Better Mobile Experience**: Device-specific optimizations
5. **Accessibility**: Respects user motion preferences

## Usage

```tsx
import { UltraOptimizedHeroSection } from '@/components/ultra-optimized-hero'

<UltraOptimizedHeroSection
  checkIn={checkIn}
  checkOut={checkOut}
  onCheckInChange={setCheckIn}
  onCheckOutChange={setCheckOut}
/>
```

## Monitoring

The component includes built-in performance monitoring:
- FPS tracking during animations
- Load time measurements
- Automatic animation reduction if performance issues detected

## Browser Support

- All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Graceful fallbacks for older browsers
- Works with reduced motion preferences
- Optimized for mobile Safari and Chrome

## Migration Notes

- Replaced `OptimizedHeroSection` with `UltraOptimizedHeroSection`
- Animations are now CSS-based instead of JavaScript-based
- Added image preloading for better perceived performance
- Maintained the same API and props interface
